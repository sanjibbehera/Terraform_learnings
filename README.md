# Terraform_learnings

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. 
Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files,
rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 

The IT infrastructure managed by this comprises both physical equipment such as bare-metal servers as well as virtual machines 
and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system. 

It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote 
declarative approaches.
